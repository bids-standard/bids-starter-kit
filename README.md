## Project Summary
Neuroimaging scans can be costly in both time and money to acquire. This creates a barrier for many underfunded researchers without access to the required equipment. Responsible data sharing can level the playing field, but the many different specifications of these acquired images cause portability issues between different labs and scientists. BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) is a framework for organizing data that standardizes file organization and dataset description between different researchers.

### How do I find information?
For general information to help you get started with BIDS, we reccommend the [wiki](https://github.com/INCF/bids-starter-kit/wiki). It includes pages such as an overall introduction to the BIDS folder structure, links to tutorials, and a glossary to help you with some of the technical terms.

For metadata file templates or code to help you get started, please scroll up to find the appropriate files that are available in your langauge of choice.

Finally, for more advanced knowledge that may pertain to specific use cases for your data, please refer to the full [BIDS Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HFUkAEE-pB-angVcYe6pf_-fVf4sCpOHKesUvfb8Grc/edit)

## Philosophy
The most important part of BIDS are the users: if more people use it, more data will be shared and the more powerful it will become. <strong>We want to make it easy to learn</strong> and more adopted. Since BIDS is platform independent and still an adapting, growing tool, the greater the community, the better it will be.

## Benefits
#### For the public good
+ Lowers scientific waste
+ Gives opportunity to less-funded researchers
+ Improves efficiency
+ Spurs innovation

#### For yourself
+ You are likely the future user of the data and data analysis pipelines you’ve developed
+ Enables and simplifies collaboration
+ Reviewers and funding agencies like to see reproducible results
+ Open-science based funding opportunities and awards available (i.e. OHBM Replication Award, Mozilla Open Science Fellowship, Google Summer of Code, etc.)

## Users
BIDS is for everyone! Programming is not required, it simply makes some processes more efficient. All users can take part in the benefits such as organized data, reproducible research, and data sharing. ![users](https://i.imgur.com/0iAMuJ8.png)

## Contributing

There are many ways to get in touch with us! Please see our [Contact Page](https://github.com/INCF/BIDS-Starter-Kit/wiki/Contact) for all the details.

To find out more about all the different ways to contribute to the BIDS Starter Kit, check out our [**contributing guidelines**](CONTRIBUTING.md). They'll tell you how to [get in touch](CONTRIBUTING.md/#get-in-touch), give you some useful resources to help you [contribute via GitHub](CONTRIBUTING.md/#contributing-through-github), how you can [edit the wiki](CONTRIBUTING.md/#where-to-start-wiki-code-and-templates) or how to make a change [using issues](#where-to-start-issue-labels) and a [pull request](#making-a-change-with-a-pull-request).

If you're here during summer 2018 :icecream::palm_tree:, you should reach out to our lovely [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] student [Patrick Park][patrick-github]. It would really help his project along if you said hello and passed along any feedback you have :purple_heart:. Please don't be shy, **the newer you are the more valuable your feedback is** :thumbsup:
