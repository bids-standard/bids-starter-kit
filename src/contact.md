We have lots of different ways of staying in touch!

**Our preferred way to answer questions** is via our forum
[Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/tags/bids) (we have a 90%+ answer rate!)

We understand that posting a question on a forum can seem a bit uncertain and
intimidating. However, if _you_ have a question it's almost certain that
somebody else will too, and this way we can avoid answering the same question
multiple times. Even if your question is not well-defined, just post what you
have so far and we will be able to point you in the right direction!

You can also come chat on the
[Brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/):

-   on the
    [`~bids_general`](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/bids_general)
    channel
-   or on the
    [`~starter-kit`](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/bids-starter-kit)
