# Contributing to the BIDS Starter Kit

:tada::balloon::cake: **Welcome to the BIDS Starters Kit repository!** :cake::balloon::tada:

:dizzy::hatched_chick::sunny: *We're so excited you're here and want to contribute.* :sunny::hatched_chick::dizzy:

The point of this starter kit is to welcome new users and contributors to the BIDS community. We hope that these guidelines are designed to make it as easy as possible to get involved. If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know by opening an [issue](https://github.com/INCF/bids-starter-kit/issues).

## Joining the community

BIDS - the [Brain Imaging Data Structure](http://bids.neuroimaging.io) - is a growing community of neuroimaging enthusiasts, and we want to make our resources accessible to and engaging for as many researchers as possible.

We therefore require that all contributions **adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.

How do you know that you're a member of the BIDS community? You're here! You know that BIDS exists! You're officially a member of the community. It's THAT easy! Welcome! :joy::raised_hands:

## Contributing through GitHub

[git](https://git-scm.com/) is a really useful tool for version control. [GitHub](https://github.com) sits on top of git and supports collaborative and distributed working.

We know that it can be daunting to start using git and GitHub if you haven't worked with them in the past, but the BIDS Starter Kit maintainers are here to help you figure out any of the jargon or confusing instructions you encounter! :heart:

In order to contribute via GitHub you'll need to set up a free account and sign in. Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) to help you get going. Remember that you can ask us any questions you need to along the way.

## Writing in markdown

GitHub has a helpful page on [getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).

Most of the writing that you'll do will be in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown). You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to render the text with a little bit of formatting. For example you could write words as **bold**, or in *italics*, or as a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to another webpage.

## Where to start: wiki, code and templates

[Wiki](https://github.com/INCF/bids-starter-kit/wiki): We hope that the easiest place to find information about BIDS is the starter kit wiki. You only need to be logged in to GitHub to edit the wiki! Here's a useful [introduction to GitHub wikis][intro-github-wiki]

Code: This repository is under development, and should contain the first steps of simple code (Matlab, Python R...) to read and write create BIDS-sidecar files. 

Templates: This repository is under development, but we aim to have two templates for each BIDS sidecar file: one with a full example (all required/recommended/optional fields), and one with a minimal example (only required fields).

## Where to start: labels

The list of labels for current issues are the same as for the BIDS [here](https://github.com/INCF/BIDS/labels) and include:

* ![Help Wanted](https://img.shields.io/badge/-help%20wanted-159818.svg) *These issues contain a task that a member of the team has determined we need additional help with.*

    If you feel that you can contribute to one of these issues, we especially encourage you to do so!

* ![Requests](https://img.shields.io/badge/-requests-fbca04.svg) *These issues are asking for new features to be added to the project.*

    Please try to make sure that your requested feature is distinct from any others that have already been requested or implemented. If you find one that's similar but there are subtle differences please reference the other request in your issue.

## Making a change

We appreciate all contributions to the BIDS Starters Kit, but those accepted fastest will follow a workflow similar to the following:

**1. Comment on an existing issue or open a new issue referencing your addition.**

This allows other members of the BIDS Starters Kit web development team to confirm that you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.

[This blog](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.

**2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [bids-starters-kit repository](https://github.com/INCF/bids-starter-kit) to your profile.**

This is now your own unique copy of the bids-starters-kit. Changes here won't affect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!

Make sure to [keep your fork up to date](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) with the master repository.

**3. Make the changes you've discussed.**

Try to keep the changes focused. If you feel tempted to "branch out" then please make a [new branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/).

**4. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).**

A member of the development team will review your changes to confirm that they can be merged into the main codebase.

## Recognizing contributions

BIDS follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors#emoji-key) specification, so we welcome and recognize all contributions from documentation to testing to code development. You can see a list of current contributors in the [BIDS specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HFUkAEE-pB-angVcYe6pf_-fVf4sCpOHKesUvfb8Grc/edit#heading=h.hds2i7ii7hjo)
